**Week 9, Session A: Exporting and Recording in Unity**

<ins> First Half of the Session </ins>

**Building for WebGL**

We learned how to export our Unity projects using WebGL Publisher package. This allows us to build and host our environment on Unity Play, making it accessible via web.

**Recording Your Project**

We also explored how to screen record our environment using many tools.
-	Unity recorder
-	Alternative methods were also discussed for Mac and Windows.

<ins> Second Half of the Session </ins>

**Preparing for Playtesting**

Toward the end of the session, we discussed how to design a playtesting survey using Google Forms. This will be used in the next class to gather user feedback on our environment.

This will help us iterate on our projects based on real user input.

**HOMEWORK**

PlayThrough of the Environment.

For this testing session, I invited my brother to explore the project without giving him any instructions on what to do and go. I wanted to how intuitive the experience felt and whether the emotional journey I designed would come through naturally.

Tester: My brother
Testing method: unstructured exploration
Instructions: none

**Session results:**

My brother was able to navigate through space on his own and described the experience as interesting and engaging. Despite not being told what to expect, he picked up on the progression across the rooms, which was the key goal of my design.

The 3-room sequence was designed to represent a transformation.

- Room 1 conveyed scaredness and loud chaos, with unsettling visuals and demons watching upon.

- Room 2 felt like something in between the extremes, like some type of change.

- Room 3 was described as peaceful and tranquil, almost like heaven.

The sounds in each room enhanced the experience even more.

It was meaningful to see that the emotional narrative came through clearly to someone experiencing it for the first time. This validated my choices.
 
**Next step:**

I will refine some of the environmental cues, like lighting shifts or sound transitions, to make the emotional changes feel more seamless.im also considering adding subtle guiding elements to support users who might mot explore as confidently without instructions.
