**Week 7 Session B: Designing Space & Unity Setup**

 <ins> First half of the session </ins>

we explored different ways to design space and how meaning is created through spatial relationships. 

**Key concepts include:**

- Space as Void
- Euclidean Space
- The Japanese Concept of Ma (the space between)
- Form and Void
- Shaping Space and Spatial Composition
- Spatial Elements- Depth & Perspective
- Spatial Elements- Directionality
- Spatial Elements- Verticality

 These ideas helped deepen our understanding of how space can be felt.

 We continued working in Unity, where we installed the **camera** and **character controller**, allowing us to start navigating and testing our 3D spaces. 
 
 This technical setup is essential for developing Assignment 3, where the userâ€™s movement and perspective play a key role in the storytelling.. 
 
 We spent time experimenting independently. Using the **Terrain Tool**, we created surfaces like mountains, grass and even shaped plateau.

**HOMEWORK**

<ins> Greybox Prototype </ins>

Using my rough map and spatial design principles explored in class (i.e. space as void, form, shaping and space), I began blocking out my environment in unity.

I created a **basic greybox prototype** using simple geometric primitives like cubes and spheres, to define the spatial layout of my three rooms (like a museum of emotions) emotional journey.

**Spatial Composition and Symbolism**

- Room 1: A small room, representing the tight, overwhelming feeling of judgement and isolation. Its size emphasizes emotional constraint.

- Room 2: is larger than Room 1, signifying transition and the growing space needed for change and development.

- Room3: is the largest and is in the shape of a flat open sphere. The sphere suggests softness, comfort and a welcoming atmosphere. Its elevated position highlights the final stage of emotional clarity and resolution.

 **Asset Placement and Testing**

I used different-sized primitives inside the rooms to indicate where future 3D assets will be placed, some large and some small, to begin forming the flow of each space.

I also tested movement through the prototype using the character controller, which helped in refining scales and spacing for each room.

This rough build sets the foundation for adding more detail and atmosphere in the coming weeks.
