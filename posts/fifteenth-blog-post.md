**Week 7 Session B: Designing Space & Unity Setup**

 <ins> First half of the session </ins>

we explored different ways to design space and how meaning is created through spatial relationships. 

**Key concepts include:**
-	Space as Void
-	Euclidean Space
-	The Japanese Concept of Ma (the space between)
-	Form and Void
-	Shaping Space and Spatial Composition
-	Spatial Elements- Depth & Perspective
-	Spatial Elements- Directionality
-	Spatial Elements- Verticality

 These ideas helped deepen our understanding of how space can be felt.

 We continued working in Unity, where we installed the **camera** and **character controller**, allowing us to start navigating and testing our 3D spaces. 
 
 This technical setup is essential for developing Assignment 3, where the userâ€™s movement and perspective play a key role in the storytelling.. 
 
 We spent time experimenting independently. Using the **Terrain Tool**, we created surfaces like mountains, grass and even shaped a plateau.
