In Week 2, Session 2, we explored the topics of *Materialisation, Emotion, & Attention* through a lecture by Darrin Verhagen. We also looked into sound libraries and learned how to access and use them effectively in our projects. Additionally, we were introduced to copyright resources to help us understand the proper use of audio, visuals, and other media in our work.

In Week 2, Session 2, we also learned about different modes of sound:
Materialization: The process by which sound is given a physical presence or form in a medium.
Synchresis: The combination of sound and image to create a meaningful relationship, often used in film and media.
Diegetic and non-diegetic: Diegetic sound comes from within the story world (e.g., dialogue, footsteps), while non-diegetic sound comes from outside the story world (e.g., background music, voiceover).
Mode of Attention (Reactive and Volitional): Reactive attention refers to sounds that automatically capture the listenerâ€™s focus, while volitional attention involves sounds that the listener consciously directs their attention to.

We also worked in teams to find hidden examples of the different modes of sound. Each team searched for various clips that demonstrated materialization, synchresis, diegetic and non-diegetic sound, as well as reactive and volitional attention, in real-world media. We then discussed and analyzed these clips in class.

For Week 2, Session 2 homework ToT, we had to watch Chapter 6 of *Premiere Pro 2025 Essential Training* and apply it to our project. We were tasked with identifying a key moment in our two-minute sequence and justifying how sound design and the soundtrack would enhance it. We also needed to consider specific sound design questions while planning.


Description
"Fragments of a Designer" tells the story of my creative journey, starting in the present and moving through the stages of creativity, inspiration, and finally, the future. The video shows a mix of messy, raw moments of inspiration and polished, finished designs, highlighting how creativity changes from uncertainty to clarity. Slow pacing and smooth transitions reflect how creativity develops over time, not all at once. The video also shifts between traditional and modern design tools, showing the connection between them. The soft dissolves and changes in lighting match the thoughtful process behind creating, ending with a look toward the future.
