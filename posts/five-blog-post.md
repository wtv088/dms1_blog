In Week 2, Session 2, we explored the topics of *Materialisation, Emotion, & Attention* through a lecture by Darrin Verhagen. We also looked into sound libraries and learned how to access and use them effectively in our projects. Additionally, we were introduced to copyright resources to help us understand the proper use of audio, visuals, and other media in our work.

In Week 2, Session 2, we also learned about different modes of sound:
Materialization: The process by which sound is given a physical presence or form in a medium.
Synchresis: The combination of sound and image to create a meaningful relationship, often used in film and media.
Diegetic and non-diegetic: Diegetic sound comes from within the story world (e.g., dialogue, footsteps), while non-diegetic sound comes from outside the story world (e.g., background music, voiceover).
Mode of Attention (Reactive and Volitional): Reactive attention refers to sounds that automatically capture the listener’s focus, while volitional attention involves sounds that the listener consciously directs their attention to.

We also worked in teams to find hidden examples of the different modes of sound. Each team searched for various clips that demonstrated materialization, synchresis, diegetic and non-diegetic sound, as well as reactive and volitional attention, in real-world media. We then discussed and analyzed these clips in class.

For Week 2, Session 2 homework ToT, we had to watch Chapter 6 of *Premiere Pro 2025 Essential Training* and apply it to our project. We were tasked with identifying a key moment in our two-minute sequence and justifying how sound design and the soundtrack would enhance it. We also needed to consider specific sound design questions while planning.


Description
**Fragments of a journey of a designer <3**

The film begins in a quiet, calm and dark environment, introducing the mood and personal space of my world. The soft ambient music as the laptop boots, clock ticks and steam rise from the cup to create a peaceful start to the day. A soft morning light filters through the curtains. Setting the tone for what’s to come.

As creativity begins, the film captures moments of inspiration. The simple visual of the pen tapping, pages turning and mouse hovering over the design file highlight the process of design and exploration. The steady flow of ideas is accompanied by warm lighting and handheld shots, reflecting the thoughtfulness of the creative journey.

The progression continues with the shifts in environment, symbolizing growth and change. A Calendar flips, loading bar fills and wires untangle-all representing time moving forward and ideas taking shape. Quick cuts and smooth fades enhance this sense of movement, while the soft upbeat music adds to the feeling.

Seeking inspiration beyond the workspace, the film shifts to glimpses of the outside world. A Window view of passing clouds and the sway of a plant in the wind evoke a sense of patience and reflection.
As the day ends, the final moments reflect on the work completes and the potential ahead. A book closes and lamp turns off signalling the end of the creative process for the day. However, the final shot of desk shows a space filled with lingering creative energy.

The film ends with soft music fading out, leaving the viewer with a sense of introspection and anticipation for what comes next.

As for the sounds, diegetic sound refers to sounds that originate from within the film’s world, such as the ticking of clock, the rustle of paper, and sound of birds. These sounds are heard by the character and help enhance the environment. While, non-diegetic sound, are the elements in the background like music. These sound modes were used to immerse the viewer in the film.
