**Week 7, Session A: Installation & Assignment 3 Briefing**

<ins> First half of the session </ins>

We explored spatial composition and how space can tell a story through form, interaction and transformation. We received a detailed briefing on Assignment 3, where we are tasked with creating 3D environment in Unity that includes 3-5 encounters, each representing an emotional, intellectual, physical or geographical transformation.

We then installed Unity and activated our personal licenses, officially beginning our journey into real-time 3D design.
