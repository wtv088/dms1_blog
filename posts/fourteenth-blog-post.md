**Week 7, Session A: Installation & Assignment 3 Briefing**

<ins> First half of the session </ins>

We explored spatial composition and how space can tell a story through form, interaction and transformation. We received a detailed briefing on Assignment 3, where we are tasked with creating 3D environment in Unity that includes 3-5 encounters, each representing an emotional, intellectual, physical or geographical transformation.

We then installed Unity and activated our personal licenses, officially beginning our journey into real-time 3D design.

We then began to apply what we learned by attempting to create a 3D solar system, using Solar System Scope as a visual reference, the website also provided us with free to use textures and backgrounds, which helped us bring visual realism to the scene.

This hands-on task gave us a concrete introduction to working with Unity and its tools.

**Homework**

![Rough Map](subfolder/pic19.png)

I designed a 3-room environment that reflects emotional transformation through space, sound and scale. The rooms increase in size progressively to symbolize the importance of each room for me and personal growth.

-	Room 1 – The struggle: Small and dark, filled with chaotic 3D assets like **mirror, sad faces and abstract forms. Whispering and ominous sounds create a sense of judgement and isolation**.

-	Room 2 – The shift: Medium sized and slightly brighter, this space features **sand, rocks, barren structures, and wind sounds**. It represents change and uncertainty, a transition towards hope.

-	Room 3 – The Resolution: Large, open and ethereal, filled with **plants, butterflies, clouds and sunlight**. Forest sounds and chirping birds convey peace and emotional unburdening.

The user will experience the emotional arc of the experience, from **confinement to clarity**.
