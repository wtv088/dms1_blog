In Week 2, Session 1, we learned about the concept of continuity in filmmaking and explored its different types, including temporal continuity, spatial continuity, and the 180-degree rule. We had an in-depth discussion about examples of both "obeying the rule" and "breaking the rule" in film. We also learned about discontinuity and how audiences tend to notice elements like movement, color, and size first when watching a film.

We were also taught how to create a storyboard and were given a storyboard template to work with for planning our shots and visual ideas.

For classwork, we were given the task of creating a storyboard based on an existing film, using the template provided.

For homework, we were asked to create a storyboard (or multiple storyboards) for our Assignment 1 project using the template provided on Canvas, one found online, or one we made ourselves.  

We could use screenshots from any footage we've already shot or include our own illustrations.
