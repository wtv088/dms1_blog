We conducted a thumbnail sketching activity where we had to select an icon or logo that effectively communicates an idea and come up with 20 rough sketches of the same idea.

 I chose a flower icon

Amongst the above drawn icons I find the last one the most effective as it conveys the message of a flower and how it heals individuals through its visuals and fragrance.

I came with these icon sketches for the prompt I slected.
