In the first week, during session 1, we were given an overview of the assignments and what to expect from the design studio, including how it's useful for things like UX. Along with the lecture, we also did a teamwork activity called a scavenger hunt, where we had to find specific places and take pictures of them or with them. Here are the photos:

Towards the end, we were given homework to film a 30-second video of a space we enjoy spending time in.
