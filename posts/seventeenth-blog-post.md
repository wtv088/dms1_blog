**Week 8, Session B: Sound, Space, and Emotion in Unity**

<ins> First Half of the Session</ins>

**Understanding Sound in Spatial Design**

We explored how **sound** shapes our experience of space and emotion.
Key concepts include:

- Sound as Spatial Information: it helps users understand their surroundings by conveying distance, direction and presence.

- Emotional Influence: changing music or ambient sound can shift the emotional tone of a space, creating feelings of comfort, tension or curiosity.

- Soundscapes: Layered ambient sounds can evoke a sense of place.

**Audio as a Navigational Tool**

We also discussed how sound can guide movement:

- Audio Landmarks
- Directional Cues
- Progress and Evolution

**Implementing Sound in Unity**

We learned how to set up audio using Unity’s key components:

- Audio listener
- Audio Source

This session reinforced how sound is more than background, it’s an active tool for mood, storytelling and user guidance within a digital environment.

We applied these principles by adding and to the mountain terrain we had previously created. We explored Unity’s sound settings independently, experimenting with:

- Ambient loops
- 3D audio placement
- Adjusting volume, pitch and spatial settings.

This allowed us to test how sound with form, terrain and movement giving us firsthand experience in designing immersive audio environments.

**HOMEWORK**
For my design, I began adding layered soundscapes across all rooms:

<ins> Approach to Room 1 </ins>: Distant crow caws, foreshadow unease.

<ins> Room 1 (struggle)</ins>: filled with whispers and ghostly moans, spatially arranged to make the user feel the state of my internal judgment and fear I felt before my emotional transition.

<ins> Room 2 (transition)</ins>: Howling winds fill the space, symbolizing the discomfort but as well as the feeling of change. Its raw and unpredictable, like my personal growth. The sounds push and pull, mirroring how I feel as I try to move forward while feeling unsure.

<ins> Room 3 (resolution)</ins>: A peaceful blend of forest ambience, birds chirping and gentle water by a pond evokes inner peace and emotional resolution. The harmony sound reflects my transformation, emerging stronger, calmer and more in tune with myself after moving through the struggle.

Each sound choice is **intentional**, guiding the user emotionally as they walk through my story. Layering ambient and 3D audio not only enhances realism through my story but also makes the user in the room feel what I felt and mirrors my internal progression from **turmoil to clarity**.
