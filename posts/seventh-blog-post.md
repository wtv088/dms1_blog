In Week 3, Session 2, we had an Improvement Session where we focused on refining our work. The instructions likely involved reviewing our current progress, receiving feedback, and making adjustments to improve the quality of our projects. This session was an opportunity to refine our video portraits or other assignments, focusing on technical and creative improvements.

Homework tasks focused on reviewing the work we had done so far. We were asked to go through our homework tasks and blog entries to ensure that our blog was both accessible and professional. The second task was to finish and submit Assignment 1, ensuring that all aspects of the project were completed to a high standard before submission.
