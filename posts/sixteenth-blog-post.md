**Week 8, Session A: Navigation Design, Terrain Tools & Visual Encounters**

<ins> First Half of the Sesssion</ins>

**Navigation Design & Wayfinding**

We focused on how users experience and navigate space.
We explored key principles including:

- Space and- body how physical movement through walking shapes an understanding

- Entrances, orientation and paths- guiding users’ journey throughout

- Wayfinding- using environmental cues like landmarks, framing, contrast and pattern to guide navigation.

We then took part in a **Wayfinding activity**, where we navigated to a random nearby location without using any digital tools. Instead, we relied on physical signs, layout and spatial memory to understand how real- world navigation principles can apply to digital environments.

**Terrain Tool Exploration in Unity**

We continued developing our environment by using Unity’s Terrain Tool.
We learned how to:

- Paint textures (grass, sand, mountains)

- Raise/lower terrain

- Smooth terrain and set specific heights

These tools gave us greater control over the shape and feel of our environments, helping create more immersive and realistic terrain for our 3D spaces.

**3D assets & Form**

We were introduced to the concept of Visual Encounters and how users emotionally respond to what they see in a space.
we explored:

- Color & pattern- to suggest mood or energy

- Presence& context- to give meaning to objects in space

- Storytelling through form- using shapes like cubes, spheres and angular forms to evoke emotions or ideas.

We also learned how to:
- Import assets from sketchfab by integrating its package into Unity

- Apply colliders to ensure the user doesn’t walk through the physical objects.

**HOMEWORK**

For my homework, I started replacing the basic greybox geometry with actual #D Assets that match the emotional tone of each room in my environment.

To address the visual stillness, I introduce Fog Particles:

- In Room 1, fog adds a gloomy, unsettling movement that complements the emotional weight.

- In Room 2, I changed the fog color to mimic dust, enhancing the barren, transitional theme.

- In Room 3, I changed the color of fog to white, it adds an ethereal quality, supporting the sense of emotional resolution and peace.

These visual layers help bring each pace to life and deepen the user’s emotional journey through the environment.
