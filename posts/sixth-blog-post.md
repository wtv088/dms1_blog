In Week 3, Session 1, we focused on Implementing Audio into our projects. This included working with Implementing Audio Slides and examining an External URL that discussed *How Music Affects Film* through the Loud Son video. The session highlighted how music plays a crucial role in shaping the mood, emotions, and narrative of a film.

For homework, we were asked to produce a draft of our video portrait for Assignment 1 based on our storyboard. It didnâ€™t need to be the final version, but it should be close to completion.
