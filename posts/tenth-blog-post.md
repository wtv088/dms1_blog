I had almost completed all the icons, but was extremely unsure if thats how it should be, so I revisted the icons and the iterations, and even asked my tutor for their advice(really helpful).

 I was on the edge of redoing all the icons all over again with another prompt, but they suggested its better to develop on the current icons. 

Made new rough sketches, and started desiging.

I kept the eye constant but changed the emotion in each, like the eye with a clock for a pupil, potrays the sleepless nights, eye with gears turning shows how the mind doesn’t stop working, etc.

Used lines and points to give them more meaning, for instance, I made use of vertical lines to draw the clock hands potraying its authority over the insomniac and sleep, the tear drop was made using diagonal lines and curve to potray contant unstable emotions of an insomniac, etc.

In Week 5 Session A, we learned about various color theories such as;
Qualities of color:
-	Hue, Saturation & Value      

-	Colour Associations

-	Colour Wheel

-	Colour Contrast

-	Colour Harmony

AND 

colour palette:       
-	Monochromatic

-	Analogous

-	Complimentary

-	Split complimentary/compund

-	Triads/triadic

We went through the Flat Design and The Pen tool slides, we learned different types of flat designs and elements that make a design, flat design. We also practiced the pen tool and selection tool of illustrator through various games, such as The Bézier Game, the rabbit tracing challenge and more.

We even had a tracing activity where we had to trace Edward Hoppers painting and I chose Early Sunday Morning.
I traced the parts using pen tool, and I traced the parts that stood out to me the most, which were the use of various lines in every part of the painting.

For Homework we had to choose 1 of our icons and duplicate them 4 times with 4 different colour variations using illustrator.

I tried different colours and found monochrome to suit the best.Green colour Is used which is known to symbolize freshness, harmony and peace, desperately needed by people suffering from insomnia.
