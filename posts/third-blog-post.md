In Week 1, Session 2, we learned how to create a strong self-portrait using different filming and editing techniques such as temporal connection, spatial connection, quick cuts, juxtaposition, transitions, and more. Later in the class, we were introduced to Premiere Pro and taught the basics of how to use the app.

Towards the end, we were given a task to try out Premiere Pro and practice basic editing techniques, such as making cuts.

We were also asked to watch Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the *Premiere Pro 2025 Essential Training* videos.  

In addition, we were told to continue practicing the basic editing techniques from class by creating a 30-second editing experiment.
