In Week 6 Session B, we learned how to export icons from illustrator as .png, through the Exporting and Layout Slides.

For Homework, we had to  review the homework tasks and blog entries that we have produced so far and ensure that our blog is as accessible and professional as it can be.

And finally finish and submit Assignment 2.
