In Week 6 Session A, we learned to record sounds for our icons for assignment 2, we rented
recorder H2N, and went around recording sounds and editing them for better effects, such as cuts and fades using adobe studio.

For homework, we have to Continue to develop and finalise our nine icon designs, ready for
exporting from Illustrator during the next session.
