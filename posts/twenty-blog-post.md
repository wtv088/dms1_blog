**Week 10, Session A: Self Reflection**

<ins>first half of the session</ins>

we focused on reflecting our past works and performing a critical self reflection.
And the first step to critical self reflection is considering your work through:

- Critical distance: This refers to the ability to observe your own work from a relatively
objective perspective.

- Changing your perspective: viewing your view through the lens of others viewing your work.

- Evaluating work: This is a specific form of analysis in which you attempt to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the work, whether or not it achieved its stated aims, and how it could be improved.

We were introduced to writing two key reflective formats:

- Designer Statement

- Designer Biography

These reflections help us define our identity as emerging creatives and communicate our evolving design perspective.

<ins>Second half of the session</ins>

We participated in a **peer interview activity**. Working in pairs of 2-3, we discussed our work on Assignment 1,2 and 3 through guided questions provided by the instructor. These exercises helped us reflect critically on our creative process.

Each person took turns answering and recording responses, simulating a mini interview. This activity not only helped clarify our own thought processes but also gave us valuable insight into how others approached similar challenges creatively and technically.

**Assignment 3-**

1- How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?

Ans- Having a working prototype was almost life changing, it was helpful to have a grey box prototype, made my work easier to design without worrying about changing or destroying the actual elements in the environment.it made the overall process of building faster and more efficient. 

2- How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?

Ans- First off, it definitely adds depth to the look and story, and makes it easier to express than 2-dimensional media.3D also provides the users with a more immersive experience and expands their attention span. People tend to spend more time on things they themselves can explore and engage in.

3- What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

Ans- It captured and presented the visual perspective of the scene, but it differed by offering more freedom and control through software manipulation for users in Assignment 3 than Assignment 2.But as the designer, I could guide the viewers through the story better through filming and being in control of the camera.

4- How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?

Ans- The use of sounds in Assignment 1 was more 2 dimensional, and didn’t make the user feel engulfed in the video and icons. But in Assignment 3, it provided more of a surround sound, which made it more real and immersive.

5- How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?

Ans- At first I started with contrasting elements, assets and materials, and by working on it more and more everything fell into place, making it a transformational experience, starting with dark and cold to bright and colorful. As the project developed, the theme evolved—what started as a visual idea grew into a deeper concept with symbolic elements that added meaning and atmosphere.

6- What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

Ans- Through playtesting, I discovered how users interacted with the environment differently than I did. Some areas that seemed clear to me were confusing for others, and certain cues were overlooked. This feedback helped me to improve the navigation and make the elements more noticeable.
