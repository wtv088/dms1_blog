**Week 10, Session A: Self Reflection**

<ins>first half of the session</ins>

we focused on reflecting our past works and performing a critical self reflection.
And the first step to critical self reflection is considering your work through:

- Critical distance: This refers to the ability to observe your own work from a relatively
objective perspective.

- Changing your perspective: viewing your view through the lens of others viewing your work.

- Evaluating work: This is a specific form of analysis in which you attempt to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the work, whether or not it achieved its stated aims, and how it could be improved.

We were introduced to writing two key reflective formats:

- Designer Statement
- Designer Biography

These reflections help us define our identity as emerging creatives and communicate our evolving design perspective.

<ins>Second half of the session</ins>

We participated in a **peer interview activity**. Working in pairs of 2-3, we discussed our work on Assignment 1,2 and 3 through guided questions provided by the instructor. These exercises helped us reflect critically on our creative process.

Each person took turns answering and recording responses, simulating a mini interview. This activity not only helped clarify our own thought processes but also gave us valuable insight into how others approached similar challenges creatively and technically.
