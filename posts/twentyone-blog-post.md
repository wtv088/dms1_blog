**Week 10, Session B: Introduction to Figma**

<ins>First Half of the Session</ins>

We went though the basics of Figma, like:

- How to create a New Team

- General layout

- Frame tool

- Shape and pen tools

- Shape and colour

- Text, and much more

<ins> Second Half of the Session</ins>

We learned two ways to add images in Figma: 

-	Dragging them in 

-	Using file place image

Further we learned about:

-	Editing images

-	Adding links

-	Used lorem ipsum to add paragraphs for designing

-	Set anchors and make connections

**HOMEWORK**

Based on my answers from the self-reflection questions last session, I’m starting to formalize my thoughts into clear paragraphs. These statements will live on the site next to image of each project, describing the viewer the emotional and conceptual core of each work.

<ins>Structure of the text:</ins>

-	Title of the project

-	Artist statement (1. Process and 2. Meaning)

-	An informal writing piece on the intro page of the website

-	Designers’ bio

I have started collection materials from previous blog posts.

<ins>Which include:</ins>

the wide shot of the desk has been an symbolic shot throughout the film, so I plan on including it in the website as each time the shot of desk is used a different and distinct emotion is conveyed.

I like how colorful and playful the icons look, and I plan on working with these color combinations for the design of my website and even include an image of an icon that I find to be the most impactful.

This image of the last part of the 3D environment, carries a deep meaning of serenity and peace that I would also like to include in the website.

I’ve brought all of this into Figma to start testing how it could live on the screen. Right now, I’m not focusing on final layouts — just dropping in assets, playing with shapes, and sketching out how text and image can coexist. This visual trial-and-error is helping me find the right rhythm between content and breathing space.
