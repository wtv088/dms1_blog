**Week 11, Session B: Web Accessibility**

For this session, we focused on designing with accessibility in mind while continuing to develop our designer’s portfolio websites in Figma. 

The topics we covered are:

**Text Accessibility**

-	Use of color contrast to avoid unreadable text

-	Along with decent font size (16pts)

-	Organizing text into a visual hierarchy

-	Clear and concise language

We then went **into figma** and learned more about accessibility in Figma, like:

-	Plugins

-	The grid system

-	Creating a mobile layout

We then had an activity where we had to grab screenshot of any website on desktop that we visit often and export it to Figma and apply the layout grid, to see if it fits.

And then we tried doing the same but in a mobile layout,

According to me, I think the desktop version of the app fits better than the mobile version.

**HOMEWORK**

**Accessibility Improvements**

I used **WebAIM’s Contrast Checker** to test colour combinations and make sure the text is legible.

<ins>One pairing I tested:</ins>

-	Purple (423972)

-	Yellow (E1FB62)

Passes both WCAG AA & AAA standards for normal and large text. 

<ins>Which ensures that:</isn>

-	People with visual impairments or color sensitivity can comfortably engage with this site.

-	Accessibility is a key part of user centered design, especially since it’s a website for various users.

**Layout Refinement with Columns**

Originally, I had a more expressive, freeform layout. Now I have refined it using the layout guide in Figma.

<ins>Grid helped me:</ins>

-	Maintain balance between visual and text

-	Align sections consistently

-	Create better flow across the webpage

I kept playful design elements like soft cloud shapes and vibrant color, but now they sit within a more structured and cleaner layout.

**Content Implementation in Figma**

<ins>I started placing real content from Assignment1, 2 and 3 into the design:</ins>

-	Assignment 1: image, link and the 2 paragraphs as mentioned before.

-	Assignment 2: image, link and the 2 paragraphs as mentioned before.

-	Assignment 3: image, link and the 2 paragraphs as mentioned before.

Each project section feels more intentional and polished in how it represent the concept.

**What Changed vs. What Stayed**

<ins>What changed:</ins>

-	More focused on accessibility and layout clarity.

-	let go of unnecessary decoration that didn’t serve function.

<ins>What Stayed:</ins>

-	bold colors and soft forms that reflect my personality

-	layered visuals and gentle animations using anchors for UI.
