**Week 11, Session B: Web Accessibility**

For this session, we focused on designing with accessibility in mind while continuing to develop our designerâ€™s portfolio websites in Figma. 

The topics we covered are:

**Text Accessibility**

-	Use of color contrast to avoid unreadable text

-	Along with decent font size (16pts)

-	Organizing text into a visual hierarchy

-	Clear and concise language

We then went**into figma** and learned more about accessibility in Figma, like:

-	Plugins

-	The grid system

-	Creating a mobile layout

We then had an activity where we had to grab screenshot of any website on desktop that we visit often and export it to Figma and apply the layout grid, to see if it fits.

And then we tried doing the same but in a mobile layout
