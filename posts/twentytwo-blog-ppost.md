**Week 11, Session A: Wireframing with Figma**

<ins> First Half of the Session</ins>

In this session we focused on wireframing, the early-stage design process used to plan a layout and structure of a website or app.

We learned:

-	What Is Wireframing?

-	Purpose of wireframing

-	Design elements in wireframing (line, text and shape)

-	Working to scale

We need to work quicky and roughly to create wireframes and choose one to move into for high fidelity development. 

<ins>Second Half of the Session</ins>

We started creating digital wireframes with the help of Figma.

we went through:

- strokes

- Duplicating elements and making it a component.

- components

- aligning and positioning

These tools helped us understand and generate wireframes better and faster.

**HOMEWORK**

**Wireframe 1**

<ins> Layout description </ins>

This week, I created a rough wireframe for my website using wireframe.cc. the layout features three sections for my major projects; Assignment 1, 2 and 3. Each with space for image and description. 

The circle at the top will be the image of the artist. Focusing on clarity and structure.

Each column represents one of my 3 projects:

-	Assignment 1 (self-portrait)

-	Assignment 2 (flat design icons)

-	 Assignment 3 (3D environment)

**Result-**

For this layout I feel its too simple and common, so I am planning not to use this layout, and continue working quickly and roughly to create another wireframe, hoping its better than this one.

**Wireframe 2**

<ins> Layout description </ins>

This second rough wireframe is different from the previous one and includes more text than the previous one. The big text on the left with be the Designer Biography with my picture on the right.

And on the bottom will be the images of the Assignment 1, 2 and 3, with Designer Statement under each of the images of the Assignment.

<ins>Result:</ins>

This layout is a bit better and well-structured than the previous, and even has space for Designer Biography. But there is way too much space for text. I plan on keeping the text minimum. 

And if I add minimum text in each of the boxes the website will look empty and bland. I will continue working quickly and roughly to create another wireframe.

**Wireframe 3**

<ins> Layout description </ins>

For this layout, I tried adding more images to look at and keep the users engaged. There will a background and it wonâ€™t be plain white. There will be a heading on the top of the website which will be the name of the Assignment. 

And on the left will be the Designers Statement, I will try to keep it concise. And on the right will the image of the Assignment and on the bottom of the image will say the date it was created on.

<ins>Results:</ins>

I plan on choosing this layout that I created for my website. It looks more engaging, and every time the users scroll the whole page will be dedicated to the project, instead of dividing their attention towards the Biography and image.

The Biography and image will appear at the end of the webpage as they scroll down.
